Weird things I had to do: 

    1.  Had to trim a lot of the template down. And since it was React, all linked components, 
        files, images etc had to be deleted too. This just means you have to go into a lot of 
        files to comment our / delete these linked whatevers.

    2.  Netlify
            a.  On Netlify deploy, React internal routing worked great, that is to say that you 
                navigate to (http://yourWebsiteName.com) and it brings you to the index page, 
                and on that index page you click the 'about' button, and it takes you to 
                http://yourWebsiteName.com/about... but if you were to start the whole process by 
                trying to first navigate to http://yourWebsiteName.com/about, you would get a 
                404 error. Too add, routing seemed to work fine when locally deployed.

                SOLUTION: adding a _redirect file inside public/ folder and put, /* /index.html 
                200, inside of that file, and voil√† the links are now working on Netlify. Source:

    3.  --opensl problem (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69962209/what-is-openssl-legacy-provider-in-node-js-v17)

        -   "But why did it happen this time only and not usually?" Because some module uses commands 
            that aren't supported anymore. "Do I have to do the same for all my projects in future?" 
            Only when you use modules that use unsupported commands. I don't know why this commands 
            aren't supported anymore and if it is related to security but using unsupported commands 
            should be a red flag. 
        -   Due to changes on Node.js v17, --openssl-legacy-provider was added for handling key size 
            on OpenSSL v3. You somehow have installed the latest version of node.

            1.  Restore your previous version of nodejs.
            2.  Go and manually remove the node dependency(e.g. "node":17.4.3) from package.json and packagelock.json.
            3.  Delete node_modules folder and use npm install to reinstall node_modules.
            
        -   For Node.js v17+, you need to put the openssl-legacy-provider flag after your command, for example:
            -   From npm --openssl-legacy-provider start to npm start --openssl-legacy-provider start
            -   From npm --openssl-legacy-provider build to npm start --openssl-legacy-provider build
